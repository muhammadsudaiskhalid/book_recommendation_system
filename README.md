🎯 How It Works
1. Data Preprocessing
Data cleaning and validation
df = pd.read_csv('books.csv')
df = df.dropna(subset=['title', 'authors', 'average_rating'])
df['average_rating'] = pd.to_numeric(df['average_rating'])
2. Feature Engineering
Create categorical features
df['rating_category'] = pd.cut(df['average_rating'], bins=[0,2,3,4,4.5,5])
df['popularity'] = pd.cut(df['ratings_count'], bins=[0,100,1000,10000,inf])
3. Model Training
KNN model with TF-IDF
model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=10, algorithm='ball_tree')
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000, stop_words='english')
4. Recommendation Process
1.	User enters book title/author
2.	TF-IDF finds text-similar books
3.	KNN finds feature-similar books
4.	Results are filtered by user preferences
5.	Top recommendations are displayed

🐛 Troubleshooting
Common Issues and Solutions
Model Training Issues
Error: "No module named 'sklearn'"
pip install scikit-learn

Error: "books.csv not found"
Ensure books.csv is in the project root directory

Error: "Memory error during training"
Reduce dataset size or increase system memory
Flask Application Issues
Error: "Port 5000 already in use"
Change port in app.py: app.run(port=5001)

Error: "Template not found"
Ensure templates/index.html exists

Error: "Model not loaded"
Run python model.py first to train the model
Data Issues
Error: "KeyError: 'title'"
Check CSV column names match requirements

Error: "No recommendations found"
Verify dataset has sufficient data
Check search query spelling
